# Creative Coding with Rust and ggez

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to showcasing how you can use Rust for creative coding projects using the `ggez` game development library. This repository aims to explore the fascinating world of creative coding, demonstrate its potential with Rust, and provide a collection of engaging and visually appealing projects.

## What is Creative Coding?

Creative coding is a type of computer programming in which the primary goal is to create something expressive rather than functional. It is a form of digital art that intersects with code, where the outcome is often an artistic visual, audio, or interactive experience. Creative coding is widely used in various fields, including digital art, design, education, and entertainment.

### Key Aspects of Creative Coding

- **Expression**: The main focus is on artistic expression and creativity rather than solving practical problems.
- **Exploration**: It involves exploring the boundaries of code and experimenting with different techniques to achieve unique results.
- **Interactivity**: Many creative coding projects are interactive, allowing users to engage with the artwork dynamically.
- **Innovation**: Creative coding often pushes the limits of technology, leading to innovative and unconventional uses of code.

## Why Rust and ggez?

Rust is a systems programming language known for its performance, safety, and concurrency. It is an excellent choice for creative coding due to its speed and reliability, which are crucial for rendering complex visuals and handling real-time interactions. The `ggez` library is a lightweight game framework for Rust that provides the necessary tools for graphics, audio, input handling, and more, making it ideal for creative coding projects.

## Project Ideas

This repository will feature a variety of creative coding projects, including but not limited to:

1. **Fire Simulation**: A dynamic and realistic fire effect, showcasing particle systems and color gradients.
2. **Particle Systems**: Creating mesmerizing patterns and animations using particles with various behaviors and interactions.
3. **Generative Art**: Exploring algorithmic art generation techniques to create intricate and beautiful designs.
4. **Interactive Visualizations**: Developing interactive visual art that responds to user inputs in real-time.
5. **Fractal Generation**: Implementing fractal algorithms to generate complex and self-similar patterns.
6. **Sound Visualizations**: Visualizing audio data in creative ways to produce stunning audio-reactive graphics.
7. **Physics Simulations**: Simulating physical phenomena such as fluid dynamics, gravity, and collisions for artistic purposes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, you will need to have Rust and Cargo installed. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Install Rust and Cargo using `rustup`:

    ```sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
    ```

2. Clone this repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/creative_coding_with_rust.git
    cd creative_coding_with_rust
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory you are interested in and run the project using Cargo:

    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```

## Dependencies

Most projects in this repository will use the following Rust crates:

- `ggez`: A lightweight game framework for Rust, providing essential tools for window management, rendering, and event handling.
- `rand`: A library for generating random numbers, useful for adding variability and randomness to creative projects.

Make sure to add these dependencies in your `Cargo.toml` file as needed:

```toml
[dependencies]
ggez = "0.7.0"
rand = "0.8.4"
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for new projects, improvements, or bug fixes, please feel free to submit an issue or a pull request. Let's collaborate and push the boundaries of what we can create with code!
